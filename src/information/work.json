            "Abstract: Social Media Platforms (SMPs) use recommendations to provide userswith content [1].  Some standard recommendation techniques can nega-tively affect the way users learn and how much SMPs can profit.  Plat-forms can to have a greedy approach when recommending content to users,which can negatively affect learning and profits.  We align the platform‚Äôsgoals with gaining more money and user‚Äôs goals to learn freely by modify-ing how recommendation systems estimate and recommend to their users.We introduce a new approach for estimating user interests for topics tointroduce diversity and treat users as a learning agent rather than a staticuser.  We found a way that a SMP can focus on these goals to improveusers‚Äô learning experiences and make more profit than current approaches"
