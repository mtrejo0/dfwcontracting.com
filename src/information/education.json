Theseimages are the default form of data visualizations, and areubiquitous across both social media and academia. As visual-ization researchers, this lossy compilation into images makesit very challenging to experiment and tweak with design deci-sions of the original author. In this work, we present a noveldeep-learning based algorithm that candecompilean imagevisualization, allowing researchers to easily edit and inspectits visual design. Our method and domain-specific languageis more general than previous approaches and is extensible tomore types of data visualizations without the need for expert-tuned heuristics."

In this paper, we explore applying regression CNNs to pre-dict the base fighting statistics (stats) of Pokemon using only an image of the Pokemon. Our CNN is shown to outperform random guessing or strategic guessing of stats. As a fun exercise, we also created a website that allows users to upload their own images to see what their stats would be using the trained CNNs."
